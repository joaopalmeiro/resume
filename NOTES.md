- Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm JoÃ£o and I'm working as a Data Visualization Engineer at Feedzai. From Lisbon, as part of the Research Department, we develop new charts and tools to support data scientists and fraud analysts. Each day is a mix of User Experience, Data Visualization, and Python/Front-End Programming. Also, I enjoy working on (personal) open-source projects, exploring/visualizing different datasets, and eating (I really like food).
